In recent times, malware has increasingly become a significant concern in information and technology security, as evidenced by the substantial rise in attacks on various devices, including computers, the internet, and mobile devices. Detecting zero-day malware has become a primary focus for security researchers. Given that Googleâ€™s Android is one of the most widely used mobile operating systems, attackers have shifted their attention to creating malware specifically targeting Android. Numerous security researchers have employed various machine learning algorithms to detect these new Android and other types of malware. In this paper, we propose a system which employs a hybrid approach of analysis to better detect malware.The proposed model relies on a two-way approach in order to detect malwares in android application. This two-way approach first involves running the target APK through a static analytical model, If the result from the first stage comes out to be malicious, then the APK does not go to the second stage for further analysis. But, if the result from the first stage comes out to be benign, it is sent for further analysis by involving hybrid analysis (static + dynamic approach). The results given by the second stage will be ultimately determining whether the APK given is malicious or benign.
